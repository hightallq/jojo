                <h2>JOJO'S BIZZARE ADVENTURES</h2>
                <h3>What is it?</h3>
                <p>Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is a Japanese manga series created by Hirohiko Araki. The story follows the
                    adventures of the Joestar family, whose various members discover they are destined to take down
                    supernatural foes using unique powers that they possess.</p>
                <h3>Why has the Joestar's saga become so popular?</h3>
                <p>The series is known for its wild and creative characters, over-the-top action sequences, and
                    outlandish fashion sense. It is divided into eight distinct story arcs, each following a different
                    member of the Joestar family and their allies as they face off against a variety of powerful and
                    eccentric enemies.</p>

                <h2>HIROHIKO ARAKI</h2>
                <h3>Who is this?</h3>
                <p>Hirohiko Araki is a Japanese manga artist and the creator of the popular manga series "JoJo's Bizarre
                    Adventure". He was born on June 7, 1960 in Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture, Japan.</p>
                <p>Araki began his manga career in 1980 with the one-shot "Buso Poker" and went on to create several
                    other short manga series before starting "JoJo's Bizarre Adventure" in 1987. The series follows the
                    adventures of the Joestar family, spanning multiple generations, as they battle supernatural
                    villains using their unique "Stand" abilities.</p>

                <p>Araki's distinct art style, which combines western comic book influences with Japanese manga
                    aesthetics, has made him a highly influential figure in the manga industry. In addition to "JoJo's
                    Bizarre Adventure", he has also created other successful manga series such as "Baoh", "Cool Shock
                    B.T.", and "Rohan at the Louvre".</p>

            <article class="right-to adaptive-text-30">
                <h3>What's Araki's style?</h3>
                <p>Araki's art is heavily influenced by Western art and culture, particularly the work of artists like
                    Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and Gustav Klimt. He often incorporates elements of classical art
                    and architecture into his manga, giving his work a sense of grandeur and timelessness.

                <p>Another hallmark of Araki's style is his attention to detail. He carefully renders every aspect of
                    his characters and settings, from their clothing and facial expressions to the smallest background
                    details. This attention to detail adds depth and richness to his work and makes it feel more
                    immersive.</p>

                <p>Finally, Araki is known for his use of color, which he often employs to create a sense of mood and
                    atmosphere. He frequently uses bold, saturated colors to create striking visual contrasts, and his
                    color choices are always carefully chosen to enhance the emotional impact of his scenes.</p>

                <p>Overall, Araki's art style is a unique and eclectic blend of influences that sets his work apart and
                    makes it instantly recognizable.</p>

                    terrorizing Morioh for years. Kira's Stand, Killer Queen, has the ability to turn anything it
                    touches into a bomb, and he uses it to kill his victims and erase any evidence of his crimes.

                <p>
                    Josuke and his friends become determined to stop Kira and bring him to justice. Along the way, they

                    killing. They discover that he is not just a deranged murderer, but a man who is deeply unhappy with
                    his life and just wants to live a peaceful existence with his girlfriend. However, his desire to
                    live a normal life is constantly thwarted by his own twisted impulses and the actions of Josuke and
                    his friends.
                </p>
                <p>In the final battle, Josuke and Kira face off in a brutal fight to the death. Despite Kira's powerful
                    Stand and his years of experience as a killer, Josuke is able to use his own Stand, Crazy Diamond,
                    to heal his injuries and ultimately defeat him. In the end, Kira is brought to justice and Morioh is
                    once again safe from supernatural threats.</p>

                    Adventure" written and illustrated by Hirohiko Araki. The story takes place in Florida in the year

                <h3>What is the difference from other parts?</h3>
                <p>The sixth part of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, titled "Stone Ocean," is often regarded as different from
                    the previous parts in several ways. Here are some reasons why:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Setting: Unlike the previous parts that were set in various locations around the world, "Stone
                        Ocean" takes place almost entirely in a Florida prison. This unique setting not only limits the
                        characters' movement but also creates a new environment for the story to unfold in.</li>
                    <li>Protagonist: Jolyne Cujoh, the protagonist of "Stone Ocean," is the first female Jojo in the
                        series. Her personality and abilities are different from her male counterparts, making her a
                        unique character within the Jojo universe.</li>
                    <li>Story structure: "Stone Ocean" has a more complex and nonlinear storyline than previous parts,
                        with numerous flashbacks, time jumps, and plot twists. The story also features a significant
                        focus on the main villain's backstory, which was not as prevalent in the previous parts.</li>
                    <li>Stands: While Stands have been a central feature in Jojo since the third part, "Stone Ocean"
                        introduces a new concept called "Stand Discs," which allows characters to transfer their Stands
                        to other people or objects. This leads to some interesting and unpredictable Stand battles.</li>
                    <li>Themes: "Stone Ocean" explores themes of identity, fate, and redemption more heavily than
                        previous parts. The characters are more introspective and have more complex motivations than in
                        previous parts.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Overall, "Stone Ocean" is different from previous Jojo parts in terms of its setting, protagonist,
                    story structure, Stands, and themes. These differences have made it a unique and beloved part of the
                    Jojo series.

                    Higashikata, who has no memories of his past and is trying to uncover his true identity. Josuke
                    possesses a Stand, a supernatural ability that allows him to manipulate objects and sense danger,
                    which he uses to navigate his way through the strange and bizarre world around him. As the story
                    unfolds, Josuke discovers that he is actually a member of the Higashikata family, a wealthy and
                    influential clan that has been embroiled in a centuries-old curse. He learns that his family has
                    been searching for a mysterious fruit known as the Rokakaka, which is said to grant great power and
                    immortality. However, the Rokakaka has the potential to destroy the world if used incorrectly, and
                    there are many groups vying for control of it.</p>

                    threaten not only his own life, but the entire city of Morioh. With his Stand and the help of his

                <h3>Main Antagonist</h3>
                <p>The main antagonist of Jojolion, the eighth part of the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure series, is named
                    Tooru. Tooru is a mysterious and enigmatic figure who initially appears as an ally to the
                    protagonist, Josuke Higashikata. However, it is later revealed that he is actually the mastermind
                    behind many of the strange occurrences in the city of Morioh, where the story takes place.</p>
                <p>Tooru's Stand, called "Wonder of U," allows him to manipulate probability and make unlikely events
                    occur in his favor. He uses this power to create chaos and destruction in Morioh, and he is willing
                    to do whatever it takes to achieve his goals.</p>
                <p>Tooru is a cold and calculating individual, and he is not afraid to use violence or coercion to get
                    what he wants. He is also highly intelligent and strategic, and he is able to stay one step ahead of
                    Josuke and his allies throughout much of the story. As the story unfolds, Josuke and his friends
                    slowly uncover Tooru's true identity and motivations. It is revealed that he is actually a fusion of
                    two individuals: Yoshikage Kira, the main antagonist from the previous part of JoJo's Bizarre
                    Adventure, and Josefumi Kujo, a character who was introduced earlier in Jojolion. Tooru's ultimate
                    goal is to obtain the Rokakaka fruit, which has the power to cure any ailment and grant immortality,
                    but at a great cost.</p>
                <p>Tooru's character is complex and multifaceted, and his motivations and actions are not always
                    straightforward. He is a formidable opponent for Josuke and his allies, and his presence adds a
                    sense of tension and danger to the story.</p>
